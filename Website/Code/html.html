                    Quentin Jerome Tarantino was born March 27, 1963 in Knoxville, Tennessee. His early obsession with film translated into creating movies which are characterized by non-linear storylines, satirical subject matter, and an aestheticization of violence, as well as features of neo-noir film and spaghetti Westerns.

                    His career began in the late 1980s, when he wrote and directed My Best Friend's Birthday. His next film, Reservoir Dogs released in 1992; regarded as a classic and cult hit, it was called the "Greatest Independent Film of All Time" by Empire. Its popularity was boosted by the release of Pulp Fiction in 1994, a neo-noir crime film that became a major critical and commercial success and judged the greatest film of the past 25 years (1983-2008) by Entertainment Weekly.
